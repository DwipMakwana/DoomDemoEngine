# Doom Engine Demo
This project aimed to recreate the distinctive 3D aesthetic of classic games like Doom (1993) using modern programming techniques. By leveraging the OpenGL and GLUT libraries in C++, I developed a graphic engine capable of rendering pixel-based graphics in a 3D environment.

## Key Features and Techniques:

+ Pixel-Based Rendering: The engine renders scenes pixel by pixel, creating a distinctive retro aesthetic.
+ GLUT and OpenGL: I leveraged the GLUT library for window creation, event handling, and OpenGL for 2D graphics primitives and rendering.
+ 3D Mathematics: A deep understanding of 3D mathematics, including matrix transformations, projections, and lighting, was essential to create the illusion of depth and perspective.
+ C++ Implementation: The engine is built entirely in C++ with low-level graphics concepts.
