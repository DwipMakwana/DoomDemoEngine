# Doom Engine Demo
I developed a graphics engine that emulates the pixel-based rendering style of classic games like DOOM (1993). This project showcases my proficiency in C++ programming, along with my understanding of graphics libraries like GLUT and OpenGL.

Key Features and Techniques:

-Pixel-Based Rendering: The engine renders scenes pixel by pixel, creating a distinctive retro aesthetic.
-GLUT and OpenGL: I leveraged the GLUT library for window creation, event handling, and OpenGL for 2D graphics primitives and rendering.
-C++ Implementation: The engine is built entirely in C++, demonstrating my ability to work with low-level graphics concepts.
